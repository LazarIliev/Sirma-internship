This problem can be overcome
 with a third implementation that combines
  the benefits
of
 the two. Keep both the year-month-date representation and the julian representation, converting between them as needed. The conversion should be lazyâ€”the julian
value should be computed
 only when it is
 required. That way, we pay no conversion cost
if a Day object never executes any date arithmeti
c. Conversely, if
 an object
  is constructed
with the private Day(int
 julian) constructor, the year-month-date representation
should only be generated
 when one of the
 get methods is called. After all, maybe the
object is
used for intermediate
 calculations only
